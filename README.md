  🛡️ Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a simple web application that detects whether a given URL is **legitimate** or **phishing**, using a machine learning model trained on URL features.

   💡 Project Overview

Phishing attacks trick users into revealing sensitive information. This ML-based system analyzes a URL to identify characteristics that may indicate phishing behavior.

The app uses:
- 🔍 URL feature extraction
- 🤖 Trained machine learning model (Random Forest)
- 🌐 Flask web framework for frontend/backend
- 🧠 Model serialized with `joblib`
