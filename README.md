  🛡️ Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a simple web application that detects whether a given URL is **legitimate** or **phishing**, using a machine learning model trained on URL features.

   💡 Project Overview

Phishing attacks trick users into revealing sensitive information. This ML-based system analyzes a URL to identify characteristics that may indicate phishing behavior.

The app uses:
- 🔍 URL feature extraction
- 🤖 Trained machine learning model (Random Forest)
- 🌐 Flask web framework for frontend/backend
- 🧠 Model serialized with `joblib`

   🧠 Features Extracted from URL

The ML model uses 7 URL-based features:

1. URL length
2. Number of dots
3. IP address in URL
4. Use of `@` symbol
5. Use of `-` (dash)
6. Number of subdomains
7. HTTPS presence

Additional dummy features are added to align with the trained model’s input size (30 features total).
